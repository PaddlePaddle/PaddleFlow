                                            to provision the volume. The pod in
                                            which this EphemeralVolumeSource is
                                            embedded will be the owner of the PVC,
                                            i.e. the PVC will be deleted together
                                            with the pod.  The name of the PVC will
                                            be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                            `<volume name>` is the name from the
                                            `PodSpec.Volumes` array entry. Pod
                                            validation will reject the pod if the
                                            concatenated name is not valid for a PVC
                                            (for example, too long). 
                                             An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when manually reconstructing a broken cluster. 
                                             This field is read-only and no changes will be made by Kubernetes to the PVC after it has been created.

                                        Ephemeral represents a volume that is
                                        handled by a cluster storage driver
                                        (Alpha feature). The volume's lifecycle
                                        is tied to the pod that defines it - it
                                        will be created before the pod starts,
                                        and deleted when the pod is removed. 
                                         Use this if: a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs, b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity    tracking are needed, c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through    a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more    information on the connection between this volume type    and PersistentVolumeClaim). 
                                         Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle of an individual pod. 
                                         Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for more information. 
                                         A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and persistent volumes at the same time.

                                            request or management event such as

                                            preemption, resource contention, etc.
                                            The handler is not called if the
                                            container crashes or exits. The reason
                                            for termination is passed to the
                                            handler. The Pod's termination grace
                                            period countdown begins before the

                                            of the outcome of the handler, the
                                            container will eventually terminate
                                            within the Pod's termination grace
                                            period. Other management of the
                                            container blocks until the hook
                                            completes or until the termination grace
                                            period is reached. More info:

                                            PreStop is called immediately before a
                                            container is terminated due to an API
                                            request or management event such as
                                            liveness/startup probe failure,
                                            preemption, resource contention, etc.
                                            The handler is not called if the
                                            container crashes or exits. The reason
                                            for termination is passed to the
                                            handler. The Pod's termination grace
                                            period countdown begins before the
                                            PreStop hooked is executed. Regardless
                                            of the outcome of the handler, the
                                            container will eventually terminate
                                            within the Pod's termination grace
                                            period. Other management of the
                                            container blocks until the hook
                                            completes or until the termination grace
                                            period is reached. More info:

                                  prior to containers being started. If any init
                                  container fails, the pod is considered to have

                                        variables in the container. The keys

                                        is starting. When a key exists in
                                        multiple sources, the value associated
                                        with the last source will take
                                        precedence. Values defined by an Env

                                        precedence. Cannot be updated.

                                        stdin is opened on container start, is
                                        empty until the first client attaches to
                                        stdin, and then remains open and accepts
                                        data until the client disconnects, at
                                        which time stdin is closed and remains
                                        closed until the container is restarted.
